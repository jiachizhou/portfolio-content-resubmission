	<p>context </p>
    <p>Based on the report on mobile game feasibility by Yilai, 
        we found that the game distribution business on TCL mobile phones(Alcatel) has a large potential to monetize, 
        so my team considered building a mobile game platform named Game Zone.</p>

    <p>This project will be constructed in several stages. 
        The first phase of the project will focus on: 1. Launch the mini-game platform in a short time to accumulate users, 
        and make users have the feeling that the platform has lots of mini-games 2. Collect game-related data to analyze 
        and use the analysis for future operations strategy and large game distribution.</p>
