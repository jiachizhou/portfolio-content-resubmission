	<p>Hi there! Currently, I am a graduate student studying HCI at the University of Michigan.</p>

	<p>When I was a kid, I started to learn drawing, which helped me develop an interest in art and design, 
			and also made me become a good observer. In addition, I used to study electronic engineering. In order to combine my interest in design and engineering background, I considered becoming a product designer. </p>
		
	<p>After graduating from university, I interned at TCL and Lantu Tech as a product intern, 
		responsible for product requirement definition and interaction design. The internship 
		experiences confirmed my interest in product design.</p>
		
	<p>In my leisure time, I like drawing and traveling :)</p></a>
